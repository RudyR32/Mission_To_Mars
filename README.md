# Mission_To_Mars
The the goal this week was to scrape space related data in order to impress NASA with the end goal of improving our chances of being hired.<br/>
Note: Mars Data table was able to be produced in the Jupyter Notebook but was not able to be displayed on the website.  I talked to multiple TA's who could not help me solve the issue.  The thought was that this could be an issue affecting windows users.  I plan to revisit this and get it to display once I have had time to find the source of the issue.

## Web Scraping Page
Below are three screen shots from the page that we compile to showcase our web scraping exercise.
